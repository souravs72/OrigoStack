# Performance Simulator Requirements System

This directory contains a comprehensive requirements tracking system for the Performance Simulator development. Here's how to use these files:

## üìÅ **File Structure & Purpose**

### üéØ [`REQUIREMENTS_ROADMAP.md`](./REQUIREMENTS_ROADMAP.md)

**Master roadmap with high-level feature overview**

- **Purpose**: Strategic overview of all missing features
- **When to use**: Planning sprints, understanding priorities
- **Update frequency**: Weekly updates, delete completed features
- **Key sections**: Phase 1 (Critical), Phase 2 (Advanced), Phase 3 (Enterprise)

### üîß [`CRITICAL_FEATURES_SPEC.md`](./CRITICAL_FEATURES_SPEC.md)

**Detailed technical specifications for Phase 1 features**

- **Purpose**: Implementation details for critical features
- **When to use**: During development, technical planning
- **Update frequency**: Delete completed features, add implementation notes
- **Key sections**: SimulationConfig, Request Bodies, Authentication, Validation

### üöÄ [`ADVANCED_FEATURES_SPEC.md`](./ADVANCED_FEATURES_SPEC.md)

**Detailed technical specifications for Phase 2 features**

- **Purpose**: Implementation details for advanced features
- **When to use**: After Phase 1 completion, advanced development
- **Update frequency**: Delete completed features
- **Key sections**: Response Validation, Test Scenarios, Data Management

### üåê [`API_SPECIFICATIONS.md`](./API_SPECIFICATIONS.md)

**Complete API endpoint specifications and requirements**

- **Purpose**: Backend API development reference
- **When to use**: API development, integration testing
- **Update frequency**: Delete implemented endpoints
- **Key sections**: Critical APIs, Enhanced endpoints, Implementation tasks

### üìä [`IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md)

**Master development tracking with completion status**

- **Purpose**: Project management, progress tracking
- **When to use**: Daily standups, sprint planning, progress reviews
- **Update frequency**: Daily/weekly updates, progress percentages
- **Key sections**: Phase progress, checklists, blocking issues, success metrics

## üîÑ **How to Use This System**

### For Developers

1. **Start with** `IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` - See what needs to be done next
2. **Reference** `CRITICAL_FEATURES_SPEC.md` - Get implementation details
3. **Check** `API_SPECIFICATIONS.md` - Understand API requirements
4. **Delete completed items** from all files as you finish features

### For Project Managers

1. **Monitor** `IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` - Track overall progress
2. **Plan sprints** using `REQUIREMENTS_ROADMAP.md` - Understand priorities
3. **Update completion percentages** weekly
4. **Review blocking issues** section regularly

### For Product Owners

1. **Review** `REQUIREMENTS_ROADMAP.md` - Understand feature gaps
2. **Prioritize** features based on business impact
3. **Track** completion status via `IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md`
4. **Validate** specifications match business requirements

## ‚úÖ **Progress Tracking Workflow**

### When Starting a Feature:

1. Mark status as `üü° IN PROGRESS` in `IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md`
2. Review detailed specs in relevant specification files
3. Update assignee and start date

### During Development:

1. Check off completed checklist items
2. Update completion percentages
3. Note any blocking issues or changes needed

### When Completing a Feature:

1. **Delete the entire feature section** from all relevant files
2. Update overall completion percentages
3. Move to next priority feature
4. Update success metrics

## üéØ **Current Priority Order**

Based on the analysis, implement in this order:

### Week 1-2 (Critical Blockers)

1. **SimulationConfig Page** - Users can't create tests
2. **Request Body Support** - Can't test POST/PUT APIs
3. **Basic Authentication** - Can't test secured APIs

### Week 3-4 (High Impact)

1. **Response Validation** - Verify API correctness
2. **Advanced Authentication** - JWT, OAuth2 support
3. **Configuration Management** - Save/load tests

### Week 5-8 (Advanced Features)

1. **Test Scenarios** - Multi-step workflows
2. **Data Management** - CSV imports, dynamic data
3. **Advanced Reporting** - PDF exports, trends

## üö® **Important Notes**

### File Maintenance Rules:

- **Always delete completed features** - Don't just mark as done
- **Update percentages** based on actual functionality
- **Keep specifications current** - Update if requirements change
- **Note breaking changes** - If implementation differs from spec

### Quality Gates:

- **No feature is "complete"** without tests
- **All APIs must have error handling**
- **UI components must be responsive**
- **Security features require security review**

### Documentation Updates:

- Update main README when major features complete
- Update API documentation with new endpoints
- Update deployment guides with new requirements
- Update user documentation with new features

## üìû **Support & Questions**

If you have questions about:

- **Feature requirements** ‚Üí Check specification files first
- **Implementation details** ‚Üí Reference code examples in specs
- **API contracts** ‚Üí See `API_SPECIFICATIONS.md`
- **Priority conflicts** ‚Üí Consult `REQUIREMENTS_ROADMAP.md`

## üéâ **Success Criteria**

The Performance Simulator will be considered "complete" when:

- **All Phase 1 features** are implemented and tested
- **90% of identified APIs** are functional
- **Major competitive gaps** are closed
- **Users can test realistic workflows** end-to-end
- **Business reporting** is ready for stakeholders

---

**Remember**: The goal is not just to build features, but to create a world-class performance testing tool that competes with industry leaders like k6, JMeter, and Gatling while maintaining our unique advantages (mega-scale testing, real-time visualization, modern architecture).
